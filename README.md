# Image Depth Estimation

This notebook demonstrates various methods for computing disparity maps between stereo images. The following problems are addressed:
- `Problem 1`: Compute Disparity Map Using Pixel-Wise Matching
- `Problem 2`: Compute Disparity Map Using Window-Based Matching
- `Problem 3`: Recompute Disparity Map Using Window-Based Matching with Kernel Size 5 and Disparity Range 64
- `Problem 4`: Compute Disparity Map Using Window-Based Matching with Cosine Similarity


## Requirements
- `cv2`
- `maplotlib`
- `numpy`
